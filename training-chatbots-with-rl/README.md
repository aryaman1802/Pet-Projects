# Introduction

This project is heavily inspired from Maxim Lapan's book "[Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On: A practical and easy-to-follow guide to RL from Q-learning and DQNs to PPO and RLHF , Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/en-ca/product/deep-reinforcement-learning-hands-on-9781835882702?type=subscription)".

Some changes have been made like PTAN's structure has been modified, etc.
