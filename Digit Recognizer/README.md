The code for the web application version (Streamlit) has been taken and inspired from the following github repos:
- https://github.com/rahulsrma26/streamlit-mnist-drawable
- https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-drawable-canvas

The model was taken from Fran√ßois Chollet's book "Deep Learning with Python" (2ed).

Slight modifications were my own.
