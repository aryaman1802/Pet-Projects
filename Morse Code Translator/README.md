# Morse-Code-Translator

This translates morse code to english and vice versa.

To run the newer version (`MORSE_CODE_TRANSLATOR.py`), open the terminal, type:

`streamlit run Morse_code_ui.py`

This will open the web interface of the translator. 

Note: I have not added the text-to-speech and morse code sounds in the web interface. I will add them soon...
